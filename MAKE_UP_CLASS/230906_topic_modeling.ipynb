We aim to provide a bridge from the student-oriented How to Design Programs languages to real, industry-standard languages and tools. In the first half of the course, you’ll learn the basics of imperative programming and manual memory management using the C programming language. In the second half of the course, we’ll transition to C++, which provides abstraction mechanisms such as classes and templates that we use to express our design ideas. Topics include expressions, statements, types, functions, branches and iteration, user-defined types, data hiding, basic UNIX shell usage, and testing.', 'This course will discuss fundamental concepts and tools in discrete mathematics with emphasis on their applications to computer science. Example topics include logic and Boolean circuits; sets, functions, relations, databases, and finite automata; deterministic algorithms and randomized algorithms; analysis techniques based on counting methods and recurrence equations; trees and more general graphs.', 'This course has four purposes: (1) to learn about the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system; (2) to demystify the machine and the tools that we use to program it; (3) to come up to speed on systems programming in C in the Unix environment; (4) to prepare students for upper-level systems courses.', 'The design, implementation, and analysis of abstract data types, data structures and their algorithms.

Required for computer science majors.', 'This course will teach students how to organize and analyze real-world data sets using tools that are most commonly used in the business world. In particular, students will learn the SQL language for analyzing data in relational databases. Students will also learn the details of common data encodings (integer, floating point, fixed point, text, date and time), how such data are structured in data files, and how to model complex data sets as a series of SQL tables. In other words, students will learn how to organize large data sets, and to answer questions using that data. The SQL skills taught in COMP_SCI 217 are essential for “data science” practitioners, especially when working with business data. COMP_SCI 217 is all about data, but not really about statistics, visualization, or programming (except SQL, which will be taught). Homework assignments will use the SQ database management systems. Some homework needs basic python programming as well.COMP_SCI 217 is different from the COMP_SCI 339 and ELEC_ENG/COMP_ENG 495 “Introduction to Databases” courses that we offer to computer science students in that COMP_SCI 217 does not teach the details of how database management systems are built. In other words, the students in this class will learn how to use a database system, not how to build it from scratch.Formerly COMP_SCI 317.', 'Course summary: This course explores the legal implications of the contemporary technology landscape, including the growth of artificial intelligence, the ecosystem for creating and disseminating digital information, and the challenges of ensuring digital privacy and algorithm equity. The course aims to help students develop a broad, contextualized view of the legal and policy opportunities and challenges associated with rapid technological change. A key goal of the course is for students to acquire the skills to understand, contribute to, and shape the dialog on complex issues at the intersection of technology and law.Assignments and grading: Students are expected to 1) prepare for, attend, and participate in class, 2) participate in one short team-based debate, 3) participate in one short team-based presentation, 4) write one technology paper approximately 1200 words in length, and 5) complete additional assignments such as readings.', 'Under Construction - Coming Soon', 'To be announced,', 'A laboratory-based introduction to robotics.

Part of this growth stems from the idea that Making provides a means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the practices and people that are typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity are seldom at the forefront of the design and implementation of Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created. Hence, the purpose of this course is to bring issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In particular, the course will push students to 1) critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization, 2) develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital fabrication and 3) co-design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity. The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a final project that encourages students to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as they work in interdisciplinary teams.', \"Data breaches, privacy breaches, and concerns about algorithmic decision-making have been on the rise. As a result, data privacy has become an increasingly significant concern in the past several years. Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.\", 'Emerging interactive technologies are rapidly transforming the ways in which we work, play, communicate, and learn. Research on tangible interaction attempts to blur the line between digital technologies and the broader physical, social, and cultural worlds within which computer use is situated. This course will explore the use of tangible interaction to create innovative learning experiences and will review both theoretical and technological foundations of the field. Topics may include distributed cognition, embodied interaction, cultural forms, and tangible interaction frameworks.', 'We are surrounded by technologies that support our everyday social interactions. Facebook and Twitter provide persistent services for exchanging personal information, ubiquitous computing environments permit the integration of computational artifacts into the everyday world, and new technologies enable people to collaborate on projects when they are thousands of miles apart. The design of such systems, however, is not simply a technical question. In order to successfully create these systems, we need to understand how people work, play, and communicate with one another in a wide variety of situations. This course illustrates the practice of understanding human interactions that take place both with and through technology; and it explores the design, creation and evaluation of technologies to support such interactions. Course topics include: design processes, prototype construction and evaluation techniques. Specialized topics cover social computing technologies, social software and collaborative systems, and entertainment technologies. No programming experience is necessary. There will be occasional labs to explain technical content.', 'Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) is an CS and Segal learning initiative that empowers students to drive cutting-edge research through the development of systems that shape new experiences with people and technology. Students participate in DTR through fast-paced, quarter-long programs (intended to be repeated). Students work with a mentor to identify a direction of research, explore and iterate over designs, prototype at varying fidelities, build working systems, conduct evaluative studies, and report findings through conference publications. As a cohort, each week students demo their prototypes, provide and receive feedback, and help each other resolve technical challenges. DTR adapts and extends agile development and design-based research practices with scrums, sprints, studio critique, design logs, and pair research.

Students implement a series of interpreters that nail down the precise details of how various aspects of programming languages behave. \\xa0Students are assumed to understand trees and (mathematical) functions that process them; the course builds up to the features of real programming languages from there.', \"The compiler is the programmer's primary tool. Understanding the compiler is therefore critical for programmers, even if they never build one. Furthermore, many design techniques that emerged in the context of compilers are useful for a range of other application areas. This course introduces students to the essential elements of building a compiler: parsing, context-sensitive property checking, code linearization, register allocation, etc. To take this course, students are expected to already understand how programming languages behave, to a fairly detailed degree. The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.\", \"Fast, highly sophisticated code analysis and code transformation tools are essential for modern software development. Before releasing its mobile apps, Facebook submits them to a tool called Infer that finds bugs by static analysis, i.e., without even having to run the code, and guides developers in fixing them. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox analyze and optimize JavaScript code to make browsers acceptably responsive. Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand and reason about efficiently. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture, since hardware relies on software to realize its potential. In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of code analysis and transformation, and you will apply them by extending LLVM, a compiler framework now in production use by Apple, Adobe, Intel and other industrial and academic enterprises.\\xa0 CS 323 Syllabus.\", 'Introduction to Lisp and programming knowledge-based systems and interfaces.

Most of the tools introduced in this course will be based on Python, although the idea can be applied to similar tools in other programming languages. The goal of this course is not about the foundation of relevant technologies but rather when and how to use them in the pipeline of data science. The student will finish a quarter-long self-defined course project to exercise the data-science tools covered in the lecture. As the outcome of this course, the students should be able to independently work on real-life datasets with large scales and gain insights from them.', 'Generative Methods are algorithms which can be used to create. We can use grammars to make humorously chatty Twitterbots, Voronoi diagrams to create virtual cities and landscapes, and machine-learned models to generate realistic oil portraits from selfies.', 'Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not). Why would a particular set of characteristics of a system lead to reaching a desired outcome, while others encounter an obstacle? How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?  Through the studio method, we will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity. Last but not least, we focus on *doing* — agile sprints, rapid prototyping and testing, iterating — learning to face and embrace fears, imperfections, failures that may otherwise hold us back from moving forward. Through this we will learn to become more skillful in how we work on difficult problems.  REQUIREMENTS FOR ENROLLING, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: While the course has no formal pre-requisites, learning via a studio method demands that students are open to constructive feedback and critique from the instructor, TAs, and/or peers. It also demands a willingness to learn together, as a community.  Given the course’s ambitious learning objectives—both in the subject area and more generally in how we approach difficult problems—students taking the course should have a strong willingness in learning and growing personally. The course will demand a significant amount of self-direction: students need to be able and willing to learn on their own and in groups through their own volition, and in doing so, still thoughtfully approach challenges new, unfamiliar, and (potentially) uncomfortable ways. In other words, the course is meant for students who are serious about learning how to design computing systems for human use, *and* of ways to work with themselves and teammates through challenges.', 'Introduction to human-computer interaction and the design of systems that work for people and their organizations. The goal is to understand the manner in which humans interact with, and use, their computers for productive work. The course focus is on the interface as designed artifact.

I see this class as an opportunity for you, the student, to see what computer programming is all about and (more importantly) to see whether you want to spend the next few years doing more of it. This course will include weekly programming projects, readings, a midterm, and final examinations. Class participation is not optional.', 'Intended for students who have completed COMP_SCI 111, but don’t have any other formal Computer Science background. It will provide an introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, preparing students for future courses such as COMP_SCI 211.', 'Overview of computer engineering design.

We aim to provide a bridge from the student-oriented How to Design Programs languages to real, industry-standard languages and tools. In the first half of the course, you’ll learn the basics of imperative programming and manual memory management using the C programming language. In the second half of the course, we’ll transition to C++, which provides abstraction mechanisms such as classes and templates that we use to express our design ideas. Topics include expressions, statements, types, functions, branches and iteration, user-defined types, data hiding, basic UNIX shell usage, and testing.', 'This course will discuss fundamental concepts and tools in discrete mathematics with emphasis on their applications to computer science. Example topics include logic and Boolean circuits; sets, functions, relations, databases, and finite automata; deterministic algorithms and randomized algorithms; analysis techniques based on counting methods and recurrence equations; trees and more general graphs.', 'This course has four purposes: (1) to learn about the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that comprise a modern computer system; (2) to demystify the machine and the tools that we use to program it; (3) to come up to speed on systems programming in C in the Unix environment; (4) to prepare students for upper-level systems courses.', 'The design, implementation, and analysis of abstract data types, data structures and their algorithms.

Required for computer science majors.', 'This course will teach students how to organize and analyze real-world data sets using tools that are most commonly used in the business world. In particular, students will learn the SQL language for analyzing data in relational databases. Students will also learn the details of common data encodings (integer, floating point, fixed point, text, date and time), how such data are structured in data files, and how to model complex data sets as a series of SQL tables. In other words, students will learn how to organize large data sets, and to answer questions using that data. The SQL skills taught in COMP_SCI 217 are essential for “data science” practitioners, especially when working with business data. COMP_SCI 217 is all about data, but not really about statistics, visualization, or programming (except SQL, which will be taught). Homework assignments will use the SQ database management systems. Some homework needs basic python programming as well.COMP_SCI 217 is different from the COMP_SCI 339 and ELEC_ENG/COMP_ENG 495 “Introduction to Databases” courses that we offer to computer science students in that COMP_SCI 217 does not teach the details of how database management systems are built. In other words, the students in this class will learn how to use a database system, not how to build it from scratch.Formerly COMP_SCI 317.', 'Course summary: This course explores the legal implications of the contemporary technology landscape, including the growth of artificial intelligence, the ecosystem for creating and disseminating digital information, and the challenges of ensuring digital privacy and algorithm equity. The course aims to help students develop a broad, contextualized view of the legal and policy opportunities and challenges associated with rapid technological change. A key goal of the course is for students to acquire the skills to understand, contribute to, and shape the dialog on complex issues at the intersection of technology and law.Assignments and grading: Students are expected to 1) prepare for, attend, and participate in class, 2) participate in one short team-based debate, 3) participate in one short team-based presentation, 4) write one technology paper approximately 1200 words in length, and 5) complete additional assignments such as readings.', 'Under Construction - Coming Soon', 'To be announced,', 'A laboratory-based introduction to robotics.

System at these scales have many custom-built components, but they also contain many common building blocks that can be reused in other systems. Students will apply lessons learned from case studies to build software systems in the cloud capable of scaling to millions of users, and they will do so with surprisingly little code.\", 'Excitement for the Maker Movement continues to grow. Part of this growth stems from the idea that Making provides a means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the practices and people that are typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity are seldom at the forefront of the design and implementation of Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created. Hence, the purpose of this course is to bring issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In particular, the course will push students to 1) critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization, 2) develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital fabrication and 3) co-design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity. The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a final project that encourages students to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as they work in interdisciplinary teams.', \"Data breaches, privacy breaches, and concerns about algorithmic decision-making have been on the rise. As a result, data privacy has become an increasingly significant concern in the past several years. Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.\", 'Emerging interactive technologies are rapidly transforming the ways in which we work, play, communicate, and learn. Research on tangible interaction attempts to blur the line between digital technologies and the broader physical, social, and cultural worlds within which computer use is situated. This course will explore the use of tangible interaction to create innovative learning experiences and will review both theoretical and technological foundations of the field. Topics may include distributed cognition, embodied interaction, cultural forms, and tangible interaction frameworks.', 'We are surrounded by technologies that support our everyday social interactions. Facebook and Twitter provide persistent services for exchanging personal information, ubiquitous computing environments permit the integration of computational artifacts into the everyday world, and new technologies enable people to collaborate on projects when they are thousands of miles apart. The design of such systems, however, is not simply a technical question. In order to successfully create these systems, we need to understand how people work, play, and communicate with one another in a wide variety of situations. This course illustrates the practice of understanding human interactions that take place both with and through technology; and it explores the design, creation and evaluation of technologies to support such interactions. Course topics include: design processes, prototype construction and evaluation techniques. Specialized topics cover social computing technologies, social software and collaborative systems, and entertainment technologies. No programming experience is necessary. There will be occasional labs to explain technical content.', 'Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) is an CS and Segal learning initiative that empowers students to drive cutting-edge research through the development of systems that shape new experiences with people and technology. Students participate in DTR through fast-paced, quarter-long programs (intended to be repeated). Students work with a mentor to identify a direction of research, explore and iterate over designs, prototype at varying fidelities, build working systems, conduct evaluative studies, and report findings through conference publications. As a cohort, each week students demo their prototypes, provide and receive feedback, and help each other resolve technical challenges. DTR adapts and extends agile development and design-based research practices with scrums, sprints, studio critique, design logs, and pair research.

Students implement a series of interpreters that nail down the precise details of how various aspects of programming languages behave. Students are assumed to understand trees and (mathematical) functions that process them; the course builds up to the features of real programming languages from there.', \"The compiler is the programmer's primary tool. Understanding the compiler is therefore critical for programmers, even if they never build one. Furthermore, many design techniques that emerged in the context of compilers are useful for a range of other application areas. This course introduces students to the essential elements of building a compiler: parsing, context-sensitive property checking, code linearization, register allocation, etc. To take this course, students are expected to already understand how programming languages behave, to a fairly detailed degree. The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.\", \"Fast, highly sophisticated code analysis and code transformation tools are essential for modern software development. Before releasing its mobile apps, Facebook submits them to a tool called Infer that finds bugs by static analysis, i.e., without even having to run the code, and guides developers in fixing them. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox analyze and optimize JavaScript code to make browsers acceptably responsive. Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand and reason about efficiently. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture, since hardware relies on software to realize its potential. In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of code analysis and transformation, and you will apply them by extending LLVM, a compiler framework now in production use by Apple, Adobe, Intel and other industrial and academic enterprises.

Most of the tools introduced in this course will be based on Python, although the idea can be applied to similar tools in other programming languages. The goal of this course is not about the foundation of relevant technologies but rather when and how to use them in the pipeline of data science. The student will finish a quarter-long self-defined course project to exercise the data-science tools covered in the lecture. As the outcome of this course, the students should be able to independently work on real-life datasets with large scales and gain insights from them.', 'Generative Methods are algorithms which can be used to create. We can use grammars to make humorously chatty Twitterbots, Voronoi diagrams to create virtual cities and landscapes, and machine-learned models to generate realistic oil portraits from selfies.', 'Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) serves as the bridge between computing and humanity. The effective design of HCI systems requires a keen understanding of how interfaces and computer systems usefully support human endeavors (or not). Why would a particular set of characteristics of a system lead to reaching a desired outcome, while others encounter an obstacle? How might a good argument for a design be instantiated with effective interface and system models? Taking a step back, are our solutions actually addressing the underlying problem that humans face? What is actually the problem?  Through the studio method, we will, as a learning community, learn to ask and answer these questions for ourselves. One focus will be on developing our critical thinking and problem solving skills through team projects and studio critique, with special emphasis on learning more effective structures and representations for thinking about the design of HCI systems. Another focus will be on learning to soften into a deeper understanding of problems that people encounter than we might at first assume - that is, developing our capacities for humility, empathy, and curiosity. Last but not least, we focus on *doing* — agile sprints, rapid prototyping and testing, iterating — learning to face and embrace fears, imperfections, failures that may otherwise hold us back from moving forward. Through this we will learn to become more skillful in how we work on difficult problems.  REQUIREMENTS FOR ENROLLING, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: While the course has no formal pre-requisites, learning via a studio method demands that students are open to constructive feedback and critique from the instructor, TAs, and/or peers. It also demands a willingness to learn together, as a community.  Given the course’s ambitious learning objectives—both in the subject area and more generally in how we approach difficult problems—students taking the course should have a strong willingness in learning and growing personally. The course will demand a significant amount of self-direction: students need to be able and willing to learn on their own and in groups through their own volition, and in doing so, still thoughtfully approach challenges new, unfamiliar, and (potentially) uncomfortable ways. In other words, the course is meant for students who are serious about learning how to design computing systems for human use, *and* of ways to work with themselves and teammates through challenges.', 'Introduction to human-computer interaction and the design of systems that work for people and their organizations. The goal is to understand the manner in which humans interact with, and use, their computers for productive work. The course focus is on the interface as designed artifact. The interface is a design problem without a single \"correct\" solution but which has many \"good\" solutions and a plethora of \"bad\" solutions. Class discussion centers on what makes an interface good and proven techniques for designing interfaces that meet human needs.', 'Online markets are causing significant changes to society. Examples include eBay, airBnB, tinder, Uber, stackexchange, and Amazon. This class gives an introduction to the science of online markets combining topics from game theory and economics with topics from machine learning and algorithms.

Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge.To accomplish this, we will engage in critical reading across a range of topics drawn from computer science and HCI, education and learning sciences, as well as ethics and philosophy.

The field of online algorithms focuses on developing and analyzing such systems, and ensuring that they are \"competitive\" against the best solution in hindsight.
